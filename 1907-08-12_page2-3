                        <head>WHITE AND COLOURED LABOUR</head>
                        <p>The seriousness of the economic problem which arises when Eastern and
                            Western labour come into conflict was discussed in "Public Opinion" last
                            week, especially' in relation to Japan and the United States. But the
                            same problem is to the front in Australia and in South Africa. Take
                            Australia-it has adopted A deliberate policy of exclusion for the
                            Japanese. Mr. C-R W. Bean, of Sydney, writing to the " Spectator," says
                            "A Western and Oriental race cannot live together in Australia. The
                            resolve of Australians to keep their oountry white is of an intensity
                            undreamed of in England." May there not he something, he asks, in the
                            fact that "while the Briton who never meets the Oriental declares that
                            East and West can live side by side, his own race wherever in the world
                            it meets an Oriental people refuses to live si"P by side with it 1 The
                            Englishman in India is the strongest case in point. "No one," he adds,
                            "can deny the danger of an Oriental overflow. There are some three
                            million odd whites in Australia inhabiting three million square miles.
                            To the North,at its very gates, up to within a day's sail are eight
                            hundred million Orientals.' The weakest point that I can see in the
                            Australian case h in the moral problem. Have we, so few, a right to keep
                            out these hordes and save Australia for ourselves f But then-Is it for
                            ourselves or for the forty million white men to come after, and for the
                            perpetuation of our race and the ideals we believe in, and, above all,
                            for our children ? Are they to look to ns for a healthy home-or for that
                            mixed horror f Senator Pulsford, commenting on this letter says that "no
                            one would dream from reading it that Japan had actually made repeated
                            offers to Australia to enter int4> some treaty or arrangement
                            controlling the emigration of Japanese to Australia so as to secure to
                            Australia everything she desired, and that Australia, instead of
                            availing herself of the courteous offers made by Japan, preferred to
                            deal With the whole subject of the restriction of immigration in a way
                            which was clearly shown to be offen sive to the public spirit of the
                            people of Japau." There are many in Australia, adds fh'e Senator, "who
                            do view with doep regret tho fact that certain Australian legislation
                            tonds to create Empire difficulties that more courteous methods would
                            obviate." In the Transvaal the problem is compli cated by the fact that
                            the antipathy to ooloured men in this oase means antipathy to members of
                            the same Empire, for the coloured men who have invaded Natal ami the
                            Transvaal, and whose ooming has been resisted, are Indiana Lord Selborne
                            says there can be no mistaking the strength of the unanimous demand oi
                            all sections of tho white oommunity iq the Transvaal for the passing of
                            an Acl making Registration for Asiatics compulsory The oflensive part,
                            however, of the Registration Act is that which provides for the
                            identification of holders of certificates by means of fingerprint
                            impressions. General Botha, it is said, will try and adopt some less
                            dffensive means of registration. But at bottom the objection to the
                            Asiatic in the Transvaal and Natal is economic. They take away business
                            from the whites, and that is a ground of oftenoe. </p>

Girco the premise that the loal had needs in future, like those of the present, then the provision for present comfort -as copied -ithont further thought as to its compatibility. From soother point of vie- these models showed the varieties of the presents' duelling!, some merely as shelters for the day in the holds, other* such as -ere used for a month or t-o of th^-pasture season, and the more complete such aa belongrd to village or town life. The portico or verandah -as the most ca •enlist part, and this agreed with its being universal for the house of the god—the temple, and for the eternal house-tbe tomb. Another constant feature -as tho tank in tbo courtyard, as in Oriental houses at present, and as in the liousea contemporary -ith these noieli at Kahun. In some eases the courtyard -all -as crowned by serrations or pile* of brick along the top. and a similar finish to the -alia might to icon in the tomb, of the modem cemetery of the tame place. Profeww Petrie here exhibited photograph! showing the house with the flying stair and the donkey’s manger outride, a bou** with a perfect portico and a court on the roof between the wind opening*, and the most complete house, of two storeys with a couch on tho ground— the coolest place at night—and a chair on the upper fljor—tlie coolest plsco by day- with a staiica-e going up to the roof. In addition he arid many other interesting results ho.1 been obuintd. A tomb of tbo twtlfth dynasty contained the finest net of coffins boats nod atatuettes that lied ever been brought to England- The graves bad yielded a pottery figure of a camel of the Ramearide time, r&oaing that that animal wo. used lor burden in Upper Egypt in the New Kingdom. The bvlli fish was often carved in camcliin and worn as an amulet there in the twelfth Dynasty. Excavation* bad also been made one mile south of the pyramid* of Girch discovering objects in tombs of the first, wood, and third dynasties. These showed that a population ami probably Royal persons livol there for many centuries before the pyramid-. Ttie main result is that a series of graves rould be listed to the reign of King Zet of the first dyivuty by tbe .sealings found io them ; and •» comparing the pottery, stone vasts, and flint knives of this site with the contemporary example from the Royal tombs at Abydo*. it was seen that there was not a single generation of difference in style between Upper and Loiter Egypt. Fashion was completely unified in tbe country from north to south as early as the first dynasty, and local differences had been already merged together by the general cnltnrc. The mode of covering the first dynasty graves had been recovered by finding pirtof the stucco coating from over a tomb. It seemed that a low block of brickwork with a battlement top covered tbeto®b,and opoo that was a brick-artbed top plaster*! over and paint*! in bloe etripra upon a white ground. This was dearly of tho same form 4s the building placed over tombs in tbe present Egyptian cemeteries.</p>
